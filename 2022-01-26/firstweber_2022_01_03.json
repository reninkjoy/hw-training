Her interest in home cooking and gourmet a little on the wild side stems from a 6 year background in the restaurant business and her skills are often requested by friends and family when undertaking large gatherings. This lead to the opening of a new business, White River Market Place (website and Facebook page). A Co-op of Artists, plants, bakery and specialty products. The shop is located on her property on the White River in Neshkoro that she freely shares. Her favorite down time is kicking back and soaking up the tranquil natural beauty and wild life that she considers a precious gift and working her land and gardens. Get to know Kristine, and you are sure to form a lasting friendship.","first_name":"Kristine","middle_name":"","last_name":"James","website":"https://KristineJames.FirstWeber.com","email":"jamesk@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/50934ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["920-229-6853"],"office_phone_numbers":["(920) 787-4611"],"social":{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KristineJamesRealtor","twitter_url":"","linkedin_url":"","other_urls":[]},"country":"United States"}

She is very detailed and kept us informed every step of the way.\"Pam Nordvall \"Laura and Kim were extremely helpful in getting my home sold!

Fink \"Laura and Kim Seiler made the selling of our home stress free and easy! Thank you!\"Kori M. and Stephan D. Zuniga \"The home buying experience can be stressful but working with Laura & Kim was an absolute pleasure! They were always available when we needed them and always had or obtained the answers to our questions. We will recommend them to anyone who is buying or selling a home and they will be our first phone call when we are ready to move again!\"Sarah Machmueller and Ryan Sell \"Kept me informed every step of the way! Laura is a professional and helped keep a nerve racking experience from being overwhelming! I could not have gotten through the sale without her!\"Angela K. Gottheardt \"We loved working with Laura and First Weber. She was very helpful and accommodating and made our transition to the Milwaukee area, quite smooth!\"Karen and Anthony LaPorte \"After working with a previous First Weber agent that did not work out for us, Laura & Kim were the best thing to happen to us! We will recommend them time and time again!\"Shannon and Yancy Suber \"It was great to work with such knowledgeable and caring people while I moved through the process of buying my first home.\"Kimberly Kroening \"PROFESSIONAL! Over and above what we expected! Showed us compassion & empathy during our \"short sale\". Although Kim and Laura were neighbors, they maintained the highest level of professionalism! Can not begin to tell you how helpful they were!\"Karen L. Marquez \"Just wanted to say thanks again for your help. It is appreciated! You know, Colleen and I have had a chance to work with a number of realtors. You are truly the best! When I hear others talk about the terrible realtors they have worked with, I just smile.\"Jim & Colleen Denomme \"Laura and Kim were outstanding and helped a great deal from start to finish. I couldn't be happier with the service they both provided me throughout my buying process!\"Michael Hamm \"Kim & Laura Seiler were excellent realtors or us! They worked extemely hard keeping us informed of the showing feedback, getting all the paperwork done correctly etc... considering we are in Florida for the winter months. They are gems!\"Richard & Maxine Eddy \"We can't say enough about the job Laura and Kim did in helping us find the right home. Our process started over a year ago when we found out our second child was on the way. We lost the first two homes we put offers on which left a sour taste in our mouth but Laura and Kim stayed positive and helped us through those situations. They were both patient and understanding when we decided to put our search on hold after the birth of our son. When we did stumble upon a home we wanted more information on they always responded in a timely manner and made themselves available for a showing if we wanted. We are so extremely thankful for the hard work they put into finding the right home for us. Again, we can't say enough about the effort they put into making us happy!\"Robby and Michelle Burmeister \"Laura was amazing! We had two offers in the first week of listing the house. She was responsive & professional-with a great sense of humor along the way!\"TJ Jeske \"In my opinion, Laura & Kim are the best at what they do! I have recommended them to friends & acquaintances since they sold my first home after it was on the market about 5 days! Everyone of the people I gave their names to could not seem to thank me enough for referring them to Laura & Kim. Some of them had sold homes before with other agents, and they told me they had never been treated as well as they were when they worked with the Seilers. Kim & Laura are professionals who know their job is to get the best price they can for their clients. They offer very good suggestions as to how the seller can prepare their home for the selling process. Advise as simple as to what colors the majority of buyers seemed to prefer to see on the walls, what color shower curtain would make a bathroom appear larger & warmer, what to remove from walls to get rid of the cluttered look, as well as difficult suggestions that most sellers don't want to hear such as replacing carpeting or kitchen flooring. All things I'm sure most agents are taught to do, but in some cases Laura & Kim are willing to pitch in and lend assistance if it is needed.\" \"I have always believed in giving credit where credit was due. And if I didn't know that credit was due in this case, I would not have responded to this survey! Laura & Kim are one of those couples that work very well together. They compliment each other and they respect each others part in their business. They seem to refuse to give anything but 100% and I know both of them feel somehow responsible when they think one of their clients may have had to settle for less than what they expected to get for the sale of their home. They do everything they can possibly do, so that the seller walks away knowing that they were given the best service available!\"Susan Docken \"We had dealt with Shorewest with the sale of our last property. First Weber has put them to shame! Laura & Kim kept us informed every step of the way! Keep up the great work!\"Gary & Judy Kline \"Laura is an awesome realtor, and knows her stuff! Laura is easy to talk with and is very knowledgeable! We will highly recommend her! It was great working with Laura and First Weber!\"Kelly Hamala & Don Lasky \"We met Laura at an open house and from this first meeting we knew Laura was what we were looking for in a realtor. The day following that open house she contacted us to see how our tour of homes had gone. We let her know that we didn't find exactly what we were looking for and we scheduled a meeting with her later that week. We left that meeting with a much clearer understanding of the steps involved in purchasing a home (this was our 1st home purchase) and also strong feeling that we had made the right decision in working with Laura. Within 2 days we started receiving information on homes listed for sale in our specified locations with the amenities we desired. From these listings we selected 8 homes and Laura scheduled the showings for following weekend. It became obvious to that Laura had listened to what we wanted in a home because we found a home we both loved form those 8 homes. The following day we put in an offer and with Laura's vast knowledge of the real estate market we now have our dream home at the price we wanted!!! All with under 3 weeks of meeting Laura!!!\"\"Laura then continued to provide us with valuable assistance in recommending a lender for bank financing, home inspectors & radon testing along with a list of items which we needed to complete and the dates they were needed to be completed by. If Laura told us she was going to do something we knew that we could count on her and she was available at anytime to answer questions that came up along the way. Laura's attention to detail made our home buying experience very easy, enjoyable and satisfying! We have already given her name and contact information to 2 people and will continue to recommend her and Kim to anyone looking to purchase or sell real estate.\" \"While we worked directly with Laura for our home purchase we are aware that her husband Kim worked behind the scenes and contributed to our positive experience. We want to make sure he is also recognized for the joint effort he made!\"Tracy Hecker & Greg Fiveysky \"My family and I have worked with Laura & Kim for many years. I have mainly worked with Laura and I think the most important thing I can share about Laura is that she is 100% trustworthy! She is responsive and answers my questions honestly! She has great follow through and I always know what is going with my home! It makes such a difference to have a Realtor you know is working for you and doing what is best for you and your family! THANK YOU LAURA! We really appreciate all you have done for us! BEST REALTOR EVER!!!!!!!!!!!.\" Marlena Jones & Family \"We just wanted to say that Laura Seiler's knowledge and professionalism dwarfed our previous realtor by leaps and bounds. She got us into an MLS portal site with listings catered to our specifications. Set up showings as early as that same day and made the whole process seamless. We truly thought this was going to be an agonizing process. Turned out that Laura made it fun and informative. I'm so glad we went with Laura and First Weber, and will recommend Laura to home buyers or sellers!\"Charity Allen & Michael Pillar \"Laura was a dream to work with! She was willing to show us anything we asked see and was very flexible with her schedule. She was conscientious of our budget, style, and desired location. I also appreciated her honest approach. i.e. she did not tell me what I wanted to hear to sell a home. We are very pleased with our new home, but would absolutely work with Laura again or recommend her to friends and family! Thank you, Kim & Laura!\"Tami & Doug Roedl \"I met Kim Seiler almost 3 years ago when my husband and I called to see a home listed by \"Laura & Kim Seiler\" We were just beginning our search for a smaller home on a larger piece of land and we were in no hurry. We met Kim and found him to be very fun, friendly and easy going. We did not care for the house that we looked at, however, Kim offered to set us up with our own site where he would email us listings that fit the criteria we were looking for. Since we were just beginning to think about this....we agreed and gave Kim a pretty broad set of criteria. Over the three years we would contact each other by email and although we had not seen anything that \"grabbed us\"...we enjoyed seeing the new listings and figured that \"some day\" we might see something we liked. Well, 3 years later....that is what happened. We got the listing for the Seville Lane home and fell in love with it on paper, went to see it and fell in love with it in person. Laura met with us for almost 4 hours on her first day back from vacation to write our initial offer on this \"complex\" property. Although we had not yet met, we fell in love with Laura and began a fun and wonderful relationship as she guided us through the entire process. We will give Laura and Kim's name to anyone we know looking to buy or sell a home. This was a stressful - yet exciting process and Laura helped us keep everything in check along the way. I wish we could buy or sell another home with them right away, however, my husband and I have found our DREAM HOME and may never move again!!!!\"Janet & Robert Rortvedt \"Laura was GREAT! She was very attentive and knowledgeable with all aspects of her field and the business! We were able to sell much faster than I had anticipated! Nobody likes to lower their asking price, but she had supporting documentation that showed us where we should be. We followed her advice........ and am now sure glad we did!\"William Wollenzien \"Laura was great to work with as first-time home buyers. She helped us along every step of the way, really listened to what we were looking for, and made suggestions that helped us find our wonderful first house! Her communication skills were excellent, she kept us informed, and she was very good at making her suggestions and then giving us time and space to make our own decisions. We would recommend her to anyone, and really appreciate all she did for us!\"Shawn Kuehn \"Laura and Kim are GREAT agents! They got me the price I wanted to sell my home. They work hard, are professional and are great at negotiating to get you the price you want when either buying or selling a home as I have done both with them! I will highly recommend them!\"Jacob Hight WE PURCHASED THE CONDO WE JUST SOLD OVER 16 YEARS AGO. LAURA WAS THE AGENT WHO REPRESENTED THE SELLER OF OUR CONDO. AT THE TIME WE BOUGHT OUR CONDO WE WERE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF SELLING OUR EXISTING HOME BY OURSELVES. WE HAD PREVIOUSLY SOLD ALMOST ALL OF OUR HOMES BY OURSELVES, AND FRANKLY FELT THAT THE VALUE A REALTOR BROUGHT TO THE TABLE DID NOT JUSTIFY THE COST OF THEIR COMMISSIONS. AFTER ALL, IF SOMEONE LIKES YOUR HOUSE THEY WILL BUY IT AND SOME REALTOR IS NOT GOING TO TALK THEM INTO LIKING IT. WELL, IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING THE CONDO WE MET LAURA AND DISCUSSED OUR SITUATION WITH SELLING OUR EXISTING HOME. WE TOLD HER WE WERE NOT INTERESTED IN USING A REALTOR FOR SELLING OUR EXISTING HOME. NONE THE LESS, LAURA GAVE US SOME IDEAS AND ANSWERED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WE HAD ABOUT OUR CURRENT SITUATION. WE SOLD THAT HOME BY OURSELVES, BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED HOW HELPFUL LAURA WAS TO US. FOR THE 16 YEARS WE LIVED IN OUR CONDO LAURA AND HER HUSBAND KIM WHO NOW WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM WOULD SEND US POST CARDS EVERY TIME THEY SOLD A HOME. SO, WHEN THE TIME CAME TO SELL OUR CONDO, WE PULLED OUT OUR LAST POST CARD AND GAVE LAURA & KIM A CALL TO SELL OUR CONDO. WELL, WE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED 16 YEARS AGO BY HOW LAURA HELPED US SELL OUR OLD HOME, BUT NOW AFTER SEEING LAURA & KIM IN ACTION DURING THE SELLING OF THAT SAME CONDO, THEY HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED OUR MINDS ON THE VALUE \"SOME REALTORS\" BRING TO THE TABLE IN SELLING A HOME, ESPECIALLY IN A TOUGH MARKET. WE COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH EVERYTHING THEY DID TO SELL OUR CONDO IN THIS TOUGH MARKET. LAURA & KIM MAKE A GREAT TEAM! FIRST WEBER IS LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A TEAM REPRESENTING THEM!Camille & Jan Charlier \"I have recommended Laura Seiler to all of my friends and relatives. She exceeded my expectations. She made me feel like I was her only customer. She cared about what was important to me and made me feel like she was a friend, not just my realtor. She was very organized and kept me on track with what I needed to do. She made a stressful time seem easy. She is very knowledgeable!!\" Cheryl Peters \"Laura is amazing! She knows her profession well! She kept us up to date with everything we had to know and do. This was our first time buying and she was always there from start to finish! She helped us understand things we had no idea she was talking about but then answered all the questions we had. She made sure we were comfortable in our new home shortly after we moved in. We would HIGHLY recommend anyone to go through her, as she is AWESOME!!\"John & Katie Legas\"Our property was a unique and challenging piece of land to sell. Laura and Kim were persistent and creative in their approach to keeping our property in front of potential buyers. They were knowledgeable and professional throughout the entire process!\"Tim & Mary Starr (The Starr Group)\"Laura helped us purchase our home when we relocated to Wisconsin. When it came time to move we called her and she came over and helped us with several things even knowing our relocation company might not choose her. Laura worked hard knowing we had time constraints and she pushed everything through as fast as possible and she sold our home fast. I would use Laura again and have recommended her to others!\"Richard K. Foran \"Laura Seiler is the best-always responsive (and if she can't be for some reason she will let us know ahead of time), very informative about the process, provides advice on how and when to proceed on important dates without being pushy or overbearing. She is extremely kind and compassionate. She knows so much about the current market, which enabled us to make the best decisions because of her knowledge. Wouldn't use anyone was else!!\"Michelle Burmeister \"Laura was very friendly and helpful throughout our home buying experience! We will definitely be using her and First Weber Group again in our next home buying adventure!\"Matthew Davis \"My wife and I have had a special relationship with Laura Seiler over the years.We went out of our way to contact her again since our experience with her in past years went so well. We were so fortunate to have her guidance and feedback along the way.She has a great gift of being relational yet objective while truly advocating for us.If we ever need real estate assistance again, she will be the first person we call!\"Colin & Ronett Jacobs \"I needed to sell my Franklin house in a short time frame and Laura did it! Everything went well and met my deadline. Very friendly and easy to work with!\"Linda Schierenbeck \"Outstanding service overall! She made buying my first home painless and enjoyable! Laura is very knowledgeable and understood what I was looking for! Assisting me to identify the perfect home for my family's needs!\"Joaquin Vega & Velia Vargas \"Laura was very professional throughout the entire process. She was there for me from day 1 until the day of the closing. She was very knowledgeable about everything that was going on. I would definitely work with her again and would recommend her in a heartbeat to anyone in the housing market. She made the home-buying process as easy as it could be and most importantly, she took away some of the stress from me and I felt 100% comfortable throughout the whole process with her. She was always available to talk to with questions and always treated me with respect and professionalism. If I am ever in the housing market again, I would not hesitate to contact Laura...she was awesome and I'm so glad I had her for this experience!\"Dan Klusman \"A wonderful, no stress experience???!\"Edna Anderson \"Laura was absolutely awesome! She was very communicative and always very professional in all of our interactions. There was never a doubt that she would be our agent in selling and relocating. She is very bright and listens well and completely understood our needs and wants and did her best to accommodate them. We were all on the same page - all of the time.\"\"Despite us getting our house on the market late in summer and dealing with confused and unstable buyers in Milwaukee, Laura forged ahead keeping us focused and kept at the process when we were very discouraged about selling our house at an equitable price. I was amazed as to how she dealt with my cynicism about selling our house and kept me encouraged and hopeful. She would make a great \"psychologist.\"\"She is very knowledgeable about how to deal with clients and also about how to deal with the technical and legal aspects of how to thoroughly complete real estate transactions. She is well acquainted with many professionals in the real estate business and has good relationships with all of them. This facilitated things greatly. We felt totally comfortable in her hands as we knew that everything would be properly taken care of and did not have to worry - even though I did.\" Sincerely,Dr. Gregory G.

Author UnknownThis well-known and fairly relatable quote holds a powerful truth: empathy in life is not only important, it is necessary. If we want to truly understand where someone is coming from or why they react a certain way, we need to teach ourselves to become empathetic. Unfortunately, empathy has become a rare quality these days, but when it is found, it is like uncovering gold.Knowing Dani Austin-Rauch, Realtor and Assistant Manager for First Weber-Lake Country, is not only like discovering gold, but more like unearthing an entire treasure. Dani and her team, The Austin-Rauch Team, are a group of outstanding agents who take customer-service to heart. Their ability to empathize, understand, problem solve, and assist their clients is superb.The Austin-Rauch Team is made up of three agents: Dani, Steve Demakopoulos and Laurie Stewart. Collectively, they have been in the Real Estate business for 25+ years.While working as a Realtor, Dani knew one day she wanted to make her way into management, which also meant she would need a team to help with her workload. Steve came on board as a referral from a friend. Dani fully intended to mentor him and work him in as a valuable teammate, which he now is today. The most recent addition to the team is Laurie. Laurie entered the Real Estate world knowing she wanted to be a part of something biggerthat is when Dani stepped in and took her on board. This completed the collection of valuable gems that make up the Austin-Rauch Team. Together, their knowledge, different strengths and different weaknesses allow them to conquer any situation that comes their way.I feel like I have it all, said Dani about her team. I have a team that can help and relate to anyone! Weve got residential, commercial and builder client experience. We can adapt and handle this ever-changing field. According to Dani, everybody naturally worked into their positions on the team and it justfit; nobody had to be told what to do.The Austin-Rauch Teams tag line is: Highly Ethical Care & Knowledge That Moves! They stand by their motto, and it only takes working with them once to experience how true it really is. If you can recognize a clients needs, you can provide top-notch service, says Dani. No matter what situations bring for the teams clients, Dani, Steve, and Laurie have the exceptional ability to understand, help and empathize in every way needed. This rare group is definitely one to be treasured, just as they treasure every opportunity given to do what they love each day.Meet: Dani Austin-Rauch  REALTOR/Assistant Manager/ABR, CSS, Relocation Specialist, New Construction Specialist[email protected] / 414.788.3264 / daniaustinrauch.firstweber.comDani is a one-of-a-kind leader. She teaches her team to always prepare clients for the what-ifs so that their experience is never a surprise. Whatever my team needsIm here. I put it all out there in the beginning so they know. She is constantly mentoring her teammates and always makes herself available. When requested, she will attend meetings and appointments with them, letting everyone watch and learn how Dani handles certain situations. This allows her team to grow in their consistency and expand their knowledge of the field together. This method of teaching has not only helped the Austin-Rauch Team grow in confidence as agents, but it has also benefited any other agents who have asked for Danis help, too.Forming such an outstanding team and gaining the necessary experience to be a top-producing agent doesnt just happen overnight. Danis life has molded her into the incredible agent and leader that she is, and if it wasnt for her past, she may not be the same person she is today.Dani has a background in marketing, and she started her career with a job in the printing/publishing industry. She remained in that field for 15 years, learning and growing as time went on. At one point, Dani and her family needed a Real Estate agent to purchase a home, and that was the turning point in Danis career. Her experience with this agent was awful, to say the least. This agent had worked with her whole family, but was an extremely poor Realtor when it came to ethics. It was because of this that Dani decided to get her Real Estate license, so she could show the world there are honest agents with integrity out there.I care. Thats what helps me remain successful. Printing and publishing was simply ink on paper, and yet it was still a huge deal for people. I needed to do something importantsomething that was actually big. I get the emotion in buying and selling a home. I got in this over 20 years ago and I can still feel it.Thats all it took; one bad experience with an agent, and Dani found a career that spoke to her heart. Dani doesnt have one specific specialty that she focuses on, even though most of her business just happens to be residential. She has experience in Relocation, Commercial, New Construction, and many other areas of the field.Some of Danis greatest strengths are her care and concern for people, her understanding and empathy, and also her ability to be assertive. Dani is not afraid to stand up for what her clients deserve and ask for what they need. She thrives off the challenges that Real Estate brings. Negotiations are my most favorite partI like to win! Recently, Dani had to go forth to a Condo Board and plead a case for her clientssomething that is definitely above and beyond the typical agent call of duty. There were issues with insulation, ventilation, and mold in an attic. I presented my case regarding the safety concerns. I do not like speaking in public, but I was passionate about helping my client get what was fair. It was the right thing to do. This driving passion of hers, and her ability to take on any challenge, is what won this case. This is only one example, out of many, that shows how much Dani [and now her team], really work on behalf of the client to do what is right and fight for what is fair.Victory is great, but hardships in Real Estate are inevitable. What keeps Dani going is not focusing on the negativity, but rather on the positive aspects of a situation. You have to learn to let things go. I think about what positives there are in the hard situations, whether its the friendships I found or the business I obtained. Dont focus on the negativity or you could be missing opportunities. This wisdom, only known by somebody who has learned and earned the ability to advise this, remains a cherished piece of advice to all who hear it.Dani belongs in Real Estateits a place where her heart and her mind are in agreement. Being a Realtor is part of what makes Dani the incredible person she is today; however, there is more to Dani than just Real Estate. Her true heart resides with her family. She and her husband, Mike, have been married for 14 years and currently reside in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Dani is originally from Howard, Wisconsin, near the Green Bay area, and she has lived in numerous other counties in the state. Dani is a proud mom to four kidsthree daughters, Lexie, Chloe and Marissa, and a son, Vincent. She also has a grandson named Oliver. Being a mom, wife and grandmother is an honored calling that Dani delights in.When shes not with working with clients or spending time with her family, Dani takes time to enjoy the other hobbies in her life, like flower gardening, being outside, bow hunting, ATV-ing, motorcycles and art.Dani Austin-Rauch is a spectacular person to know, whether its as a friend or an agent. When you know Dani, you can be sure you are getting exactly what you see: an honest, hardworking person who will always stand up for whats right. Dani and The Austin-Rauch Team are ready and willing to make sure your Real Estate experience is successful. They care. They understand. They want to help. If you want to know what it feels like to have struck gold, just give them a callyoull feel like youve won before you even begin.Fun Facts:Favorite Sports Team-Green Bay PackersFavorite Restaurant-Union HouseDream Vacation-Anywhere with a beach and an ocean.

I start each process by thoroughly discussing and finding clarity on my clients goals, and then work with them to put systems in place that ensure success. My objective is always to get you to your destination in the timeframe you are looking for, with the least inconvenience, and for the best possible price. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater with a BA in Marketing in 1986, I decided to follow in my fathers footsteps and enter the real estate industry. Between 1986 and 2001, I worked in our familys Century 21 office in both a sales and management capacity. In 2001 we merged with First Weber Realty, which was a locally owned company expanding throughout Wisconsin. First Weber would soon become the most productive real estate company in Wisconsin. In 2015, our acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway expanded our companies reach and ability. It has been a lot of fun watching our company grow and continue to expand the tools that allow us to be a leader in our industry. In late 2019, after 23 years of management, I made the exciting decision to step out of the management roll and concentrate full time on being a trusted real estate consultant to my clients. My decades of experience in all types of real estate markets gives me the knowledge to help you with all of your needs. Whether its giving a recommendation on contractors, help finding a realtor anywhere in the world, or developing a game plan to sell your current home and find your dream home; if I dont have the answer, I will find it for you. The ultimate sign that I am accomplishing my goals is when you feel confident referring my services to your friends, family or coworkers that have real estate needs or wants.

Many of my clients have been first time buyers; homes, condos, and even land! No one wants to move into a house to be surprised by repairs or not understand the paperwork, this is where I come in with excellent service. Understanding what a buyer wants in turn becomes what selling a home requires. Sellers do not want inflated prices or their homes sitting on the market for a long time. One of my clients said, She helped me to come up with a great price for a house and her selling strategy helped us to sell the house within a week! Marketing and attracting new buyers are key to successful buying and selling. A client may initiate their search for the perfect home online, but a realtor is essential to close the deal. My goal is to earn your trust, referrals, and repeat business. I take a personable approach to both aspects of the real estate process, buying and selling is my specialty. I help buyers focus their search and sellers get the most value for their home.

You have gone above and beyond and I will always remember how magnificent you were with the whole process. You rock!\" ~Nyra\"\"You have been nothing short of amazing! We are so happy to have worked with you. Thanks for helping us keep our sanity during this crazy time. We are so excited to start the next chapter of our life in our new beautiful home and we owe it all to you! Thank you so much! ~Sarah & Dan\"\"Thank you for everything you did to help us buy our new home. Your knowledge, commitment, availability and support made this deal happen. We love our new home and are grateful we met you this summer on this journey. Sincerely, Julia & Don\"\"Hi Cheryl, we just wanted to thank you for everything that you have done for us and all the time you spent with us. We are loving our new house . . . projects and all! ~Brie & Patrick\"\"Cheryl was a pleasure to work with; with a work ethic that you don't see very much of these days. She took a house that sat on the market for over 3 years and sold it in under 6 months. Now that's what I call a REALTOR!! My hat's off to you Cheryl. A million thank you's! ~ Cherie\"\"Cheryl was extremely professional and assisted me during a difficult time of my fathers death. I would highly recommend her. ~Pat\"\"We just want to thank you for all you have done for us in finding the perfect home. Your knowledge, patience, and extra effort was very much appreciated. We absolutely love our new home ~ it's perfect. Thanks again for everything! ~Scott & Amy\"\"Cheryl was excellent. We enjoyed working with her. She was professional yet personable. We appreciated her knowledgeable insight. I would highly recommend her as an agent for either buying or selling a home. ~Herbert\"\"Cheryl was fantastic. She listened to us and told us about our house. She offered decorating suggestions which I loved while walking through the houses. She seemed to really understand us. I have already recommended her to my co-workers. ~David & Christina\"\"Cheryl was great - I've had a bad agent before and boy, what a stark contrast. I would absolutely come back to Cheryl for any future real estate transactions in the Stevens Point area. Thanks! ~Matthew\"\"Question F asked about professional appearance. Amazingly, we have no clue and yet that is a positive testimony to the ability of Cheryl to conduct the important business of our private real estate transaction at a distance. As the Seller, we accompished all phases via email, telephone, and standard mail without feeling taht we needed to make the 350 mile trek back to Stevens Point. Frankly, Cheryl and all involved were given a tough road by the buyer. Constantly making new demands and unreasonable expectations became the expected. Fortunately, Cheryl's professionalism guided us through this otherwise difficult transaction. We have Cheryl to thank for the final positive outcome for all involved. ~Mark & Maria\"\"Chery went above and beyond to make our home selling and buying experiences as smooth as possible. She provided appointments that accommodated our busy work schedules. She is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and caring. We would highly recommend her to anyone! ~Jessica & Matt\"","first_name":"Cheryl","middle_name":"Augustyniak","last_name":"Bushman","website":"https://CherylBushman.FirstWeber.com","email":"bushmanc@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/28777ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["(715) 340-5565"],"office_phone_numbers":["(715) 343-4421"],"social":{},"country":"United States"}

I have been married to my husband Adam for over 16 years and we have a soon to be 15 year old son that is on the swim team at his high school. I truly enjoy working with people and helping them sell or find their perfect home. It is such a pleasure to meet new people and show them how and why I fell in love with Rome, Wisconsin.","first_name":"Cheryl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bournoville","website":"https://CherylBournoville.FirstWeber.com","email":"bournovillec@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/141427ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["262-497-4599"],"office_phone_numbers":["(715) 325-9000"],"social":{},"country":"United States"}

Where are you from? My Dad was in sales, so we moved several times while I was growing up, Illinois, Ohio, Southern California. I went to high school and college in North Carolina, and have lived in Wisconsin since 1998. How did you get into real estate? I spent the first 20 years of my career in healthcare in varying capacities; sales, business development, administration, and consulting. I have always enjoyed the process of working with a Client to turn an idea or a dream into a reality. I obtained my license in 2016 and began working with my partner Deanna (and First Weber Group) at that time. What do you enjoy most about your career? To me, the most important part of the \"deal\" is developing a relationship with my Client. Understanding what they want, developing a strategy, and earning their trust. Anyone can sell you something. The best Realtors invest the time and energy to become a trusted advisor and resource for their Clients. When you are not at work? I am the proud father of three wonderful kids, and a very happy partner to Deanna. We live in rural Roxbury, and enjoy spending time with fiends and family in the greater Sauk Prairie and Lake Wisconsin areas. I love to spend time being active in the outdoors, and traveling both domestically and abroad.

I have been living in Oshkosh Wisconsin since 1989. I Married Roberta Gerhartz on August 10, 1991. I have worked for NM Transfer Co. Inc. as a truck driver since 1990. I drove from Neenah to the Chicago area for most of my tenure. A few years in there I drove different areas of Wisconsin so I am very familiar with a lot of areas in the state of Wisconsin as well as a lot of northeast, northwest areas including the Chicago area of Illinois.In October of 2015, I received my Real Estate License. In February of 2016, I joined the FirstWeber Oshkosh Brokerage Team and for four years, I drove semi truck with NM Transfer and sold real estate with FirstWeber Oshkosh. February 10, 2020, I retired from my long life of truck driving and went full steam ahead in the real estate. Through the years, I have sold waterfront, condo's, duplex's, vacant land, commercial, and residential. I've sold properties ranging from $50,000 to $637,000. I've sold a church, a pheasant farm, and many different houses. I enjoy working with people and do whatever I can to make your move as simple as possible. In the year 2020 we all faced many different challenges. We have overcome many setbacks and downfalls. I managed to more than double my production in sales from previous years. I earned the Crystal Star Award, Excellence in Client Service Award, First Weber Presidents Silver Circle Award. My wife Roberta and I are very excited that I made the change as we get to spend a little more time together with each other and our English Bulldog, Mylee. I enjoy riding motorcycles, boating, bicycle riding, and spending quiet evenings on our deck just sitting back and relaxing. I believe that being a Realtor is not only a business, it is a friendship. I am happily ready to serve you and your family to make this the simplest move of your life. Thank you for allowing me to assist you and never hesitate once to call on me with any questions or concerns you may have. I am and will be here for you every step of the way.

You can be a masterfully trained Realtor, but it doesn't mean you're good. Being successful to me, isn't about high sales figures or being number one in the office. To be successful in my mind is having the ability to guide each Client in a respectful and caring fashion with the skill and concern that you would provide for a family member. I subscribe to the philosophy that it takes commitment... to each and every person who places trust in me- to help them through a successful transaction. I'm not a high pressure salesperson; I prefer a style that pays attention to detail and presents you with choices in an effective and timely manner to achieve your desired outcome. I understand Seniors and their changing life needs and I welcome first time home buyers and recognize the emotions and concerns that go along with buying your first residence. I have the technological capability to successfully market property in this new world of everything Internet with the help of the wonderful resources that First Weber Group has provided. I love what I do and I'm delighted with the Company I work for. I'm am pleased to have relations with professional and ethical lenders, who are as committed to your transaction as I am and in addition, I have the enthusiasm to accomplish what you need and desire- Always with a smile and personality.

She recognizes that buying or selling a home is an important step in each of her customers' and clients' lives. That's precisely why Sharon keeps her clients and customers informed every step of the way - so that they can make prudent decisions about their transactions.Testimonials\"Sharon has provided an outstanding level of quality service and has proved to be a valuable asset to myself and my family. Her dedication, attention to detail, and follow through on every issue, question, concern, and suggestion has been timely and right on target. From assistance in pricing the property to guidance and help with title search, inspection, etc. As a homeowner who has tried the FSBO route, as well as listing with another company a few years ago, (both unsucccessful and highly frustrating) I can now state emphatically that the answer to the question 'Why Pay 6?' is Sharon K. Geboy. Her effort, concern and hard work are worth much more! It is rare to find someone like Sharon. My family and I feel fortunate and blessed to have had the opportunity to work with her.

When I am not working, you can find me out doing yard work, taking my dog Tilly for a run, or playing golf, volleyball or tennis. I enjoy socializing with friends and family, helping out in the community, and traveling to various vacation destinations.

Sarah Venes Agent Story\"The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.\" Jimmy Johnson (Author) A little extra.What does that mean? How do you take an ordinary business professional and make her extraordinary? Perhaps it takes a little extra hard-work, a little extra love for the job or a little extra knowledge of the industry. Sure, those are all great extras to give, but I believe there is another key to unlocking the door to extraordinary. Sarah Venes, from First Weber's Lake Country office, has that little extra something to give. She is part of an elite group within the Real Estate industry where only 5% of all Realtors in the country chose Real Estate as their first and primary profession in life. That means, 95% of all the agents we meet first pursued other careers before deciding to try their hand in Real Estate, but not Sarah. Having made this career her one-and-only, Sarah's fierce drive quickly took her above the status of an ordinary agent and turned her into an extraordinary Real Estate professional.Sarah has always had a love for interior design and home-staging. She discovered early-on how Real Estate incorporates both of her interests, so Sarah decided to become a Realtor and combine her passions into one great career. Sarah didn't stop there. She took her title a step further and got certified in home-staging, which allows her to offer clients a little extra, aside from just buying and selling. Sarah and her Husband have been remodeling their home over the last couple of years, and have helped many friends and clients pick out finishes and paint colors. She has valuable insight on the remodeling process and can help open your eyes to a homes potential. The flexible and rewarding work Sarah does enables her to make her own schedule and still make time for the personal treasures in her life. Outside of Real Estate she enjoys spending time cooking, remodeling her home, hanging out with her husband, Dax, and playing with their beloved rescue dog, Mercy. You can follow along as she showcases that aspect of her life on Instagram. In a world where technology is constantly advancing, Sarah has the abilities and resources to adapt right along with it. From the convenience of e-signatures and live video showings, to immediate access of all properties on the market and social media advertising, Sarah is a refreshing blend of traditional Real Estate service infused with the latest resources. She is phenomenal Realtor who raises the bar to a new high for those who work with her.Sarah's level of professionalism and devotion to the job is unparalleled. She not only helps her clients achieve their final goal in Real Estate, but she does it in such a way that lasting friendships are created. \"I love the relationship I can build with clients. We become friends, We talk almost every day. When the deal closes and you stop talking you miss each other.\" Sarah's friendly demeanor allows her to provide each client with a steadfast guidance throughout her transactions. Her number one priority is making sure she is with her clients every step of the way. From showing up to every single appointment to thoroughly laying out each step that lies ahead, before the process even beings and staying on top of tasks throughout, Sarah is the definition of dependable.It doesn't take much time with Sarah to notice her gentle spirit. She listens more than she talks, absorbing what she needs to best assist her clients. She is a firm believer that honesty is the best policy. Sarah tells her clients the truth, whether it's good or bad, so they never have to wonder if details are being hidden. She is by her client's side the whole time, walking them through their buying or selling journey. \"I give them options and time to think about what they want to do. It's their money and their decision, but I'm there to help guide them forward.\" Sarah knows how intense this experience can be and how big of a decision her clients are making. \"It's exciting and it's an exhilarating challenge. Every client, every deal, every day, it's different. It's not your basic nine-to-five job. I love getting to problem solve and help my clients.\" Sarah thrives on finding people what they want and has fun in the process, it's what she does best. Her mind is always focused and ready to go.Ordinary? Definitely not Sarah is anything but. Her fun-loving attitude and gorgeous smile are privileges to see. Her mindset is sharp, her demeanor is energizing, and her knowledge is exceptional. Sarah goes above and beyond every time, always giving that little extra. When looking for a genuine, dependable agent, meet with Sarah; her little extra will be with you every step of the way.","first_name":"Sarah","middle_name":"","last_name":"Venes","website":"https://sarahkugi-venes.firstweber.com","email":"svenes@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/114449ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["262-349-5083"," 262-337-9287"],"office_phone_numbers":["(262) 646-6800"],"social":{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/sarahvenesrealtor/","twitter_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahkugi/","other_urls":["https://www.pinterest.com/sarahvenesrealtor/","https://www.instagram.com/venes_sarah/"]},"country":"United States"}

I began selling lemonade to the neighbors and going door to door asking if I could help with yard work.

His passion for real estate was ignited in 2014 when he began considering duplex ownership in Oconomowoc.I spent a couple of years to save up and purchase my very first duplex in 2016. After owning my first duplex for a year, I was hooked! I went on to form a partnership with a friend and together we purchased and co-own two multi-families, and one single family unit. While purchasing the three rental units, we started an investor group, Michael said.In early 2019 Michael launched his real estate career.

Roger also is General Sales Manager of First Webers Lake Country office. Roger has been in the real estate since 1983. He was the 2006 Chairman for the Wisconsin Realtors Association and a current Director of the Greater Milwaukee Area Realtors. Roger loves to play golf and is very involved in the Lake Country community especially with the First Weber Foundation. Roger lives in Oconomowoc with his wife Nancy,. Roger and Nancy have 2 children, Charles 28, Kelly 26 and became a Grandpa in 2021.Question: How did you get into the real estate business?I grew up around the real estate business. My father started in real estate with Cliff Robedeaux in the early seventies.Question: What qualities do you think make a successful REALTOR?First and foremost - passion. If you are not passionate about what you do, your customers and clients will sense that. To be successful, you have to eat, sleep and breathe real estate. Along with that, you have to know how to balance between your business life and your family life. A sense of humor is another trait that I see in the most successful agents.Question: What tips would you give to a Realtor who is just starting out?Success breeds success. I think the most important thing a new REALTOR can do to insure their success is to surround themselves with positive, successful people. This includes supportive and knowledgeable management and successful agents who are willing to mentor, give advice and share their success stories with newer agents.Question: What changes do you see in the future for the real estate industry?I think we will continue to see changes taking place to the traditional transaction model in terms of the consumer's ability to access information prior to establishing a relationship with an agent. However, I feel it is essential for Agents and Brokers to understand that in order to best serve Customers and Clients, is that good Agents need good Brokers and good Brokers need good Agents. This will require that we keep up with emerging technologies, real estate legislation, and other trends that affect the level of service we give to the agents, which will, in turn, affect the level of service they give to their customers and clients.Question: Where do you see First Weber Group Realtors in the next several years?Expansion and growth! Being owned now by Berkshire Hathaway has created many strong partnerships with both local and National companies. We will continue to brand the First Weber Group name across Wisconsin.","first_name":"Roger","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rushman","website":"https://RogerRushman.FirstWeber.com","email":"rrushman@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/10585ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["(414) 333-5313"],"office_phone_numbers":["262 646-6800"],"social":{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/rrushman","twitter_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/rogerrushman","other_urls":[]},"country":"United States"}

Abe is a student of residential Wisconsin Real Estate, keeping his finger on the pulse of the market like few others do. His love, expertise and commitment to Real Estate has earned him the respect of sellers, buyers, builders and contemporaries alike. While typically focusing on the Jefferson and Western Waukesha County real estate markets, Abe has participated in numerous real estate transactions through out the State of Wisconsin. Abe also proudly serves as the twice elected President of the Jefferson County Board of Realtors.Sellers: When listing your property with Abe, you will receive an aggressive and relentless, state of the art web and social media based marketing campaign - Abe has never NOT been able to present his Seller with an Offer. Abe understands the wording of Offer contingencies to the letter. He provides invaluable counsel in such matters. Abe will keep you up to date on the sales process from acceptance to close.Buyers: As a dedicated, full-time real estate professional, Abe receives minute-to-minute updates through strategic networking with other agents, builders, Buyers and Sellers; he often knows of properties before they hit the market. This amounts to you having a better edge on competing buyers and a higher probability of both finding a home that matches your search criteria and negotiating successfully for that home.Knowledge: In a fast-paced market, sometimes hours make all the difference between successfully negotiating for the home you have been looking for and a missed sale. Knowledge of the market, when to move on an offer and then moving quickly is key. Abe is a student of the market; He keeps his finger of the pulse of the market and market trends like few others.Before beginning his career in Real Estate, Abe spent nearly a decade as a Territory Manager for Case International and then later, John Deere.

I wouldn't trade growing up in a small town as it has provided me with many opportunities such as getting my start in law enforcement, getting to know many people in and around the surrounding communities, and it has allowed me to work with the same local bank on a personal level for the past 20 years. I'm a 2001 graduate of Johnson Creek High School. I received a baseball scholarship to Illinois Valley Community College in LaSalle-Peru, IL where I received an Associates Degree in Science and was a 2nd team All-American outfielder. I continued my education at Bradley and Western Illinois both on a baseball scholarship. In 2005 I was hired as a part-time police officer in Jefferson, WI. I have continued my law enforcement career as a full-time police officer in the city of Fort Atkinson for the past 10 years and contributed 3 years of part-time service to the City of Lake Mills Police Department. Just as I have served and protected citizens in Jefferson County for the past 14 years. I am committed to serving and protecting all your real Estate needs! I also take pride in being active in the community as I have been an assistant coach for the Jefferson High School Varsity Baseball team. I've coached the Jefferson Blue Devils Home Talent Baseball team the last several years and in 2018 we won the Night League Championship, which hadn't been done in 28 years. I also volunteer time to coach the 11-12 year old Jr. Eagles baseball team.I've raised money through baseball tournaments and have donated the money to Jefferson High School and Jefferson Blue Devils to help maintain Fischer Field, to the Jr Eagles baseball team to help with tournaments fees and to the Jefferson Rec Department to help buy equipment for youth players.

How did you get into the Real Estate business?Sarah became a full time licensed Realtor at 18 years of age and never looked back. She recalls interviewing brokers while in high school at Waukesha West. Sarah enjoys the concrete, sequential process of the business as organization and planning are personal strengths. What is your main focus for agents coming to your office?Sarah is fulfilled by watching agents succeed. She emphasizes training and education for both new & seasoned Realtors.

What qualities do you think make a successful Realtor?Honesty and integrity are the foundation which cultivate lifelong relationships with clients and fellow agents/brokers in the industry.

Roger also is General Sales Manager of First Webers Lake Country office. Roger has been in the real estate industry for over 37 years. He was the 2006 Chairman for the Wisconsin Realtors Association and a current Director of the Greater Milwaukee Area Realtors. Roger loves to play golf and is very involved in the Lake Country community especially with the First Weber Foundation. Roger lives in Oconomowoc with his wife Nancy,. Roger and Nancy have 2 children, Charles 26, Kelly 24.Question: How did you get into the real estate business?I grew up around the real estate business. My father started in real estate with Cliff Robedeaux in the early seventies.Question: What qualities do you think make a successful REALTOR?First and foremost - passion. If you are not passionate about what you do, your customers and clients will sense that. To be successful, you have to eat, sleep and breathe real estate. Along with that, you have to know how to balance between your business life and your family life. A sense of humor is another trait that I see in the most successful agents.Question: What tips would you give to a Realtor who is just starting out?Success breeds success. I think the most important thing a new REALTOR can do to insure their success is to surround themselves with positive, successful people. This includes supportive and knowledgeable management and successful agents who are willing to mentor, give advice and share their success stories with newer agents.Question: What changes do you see in the future for the real estate industry?I think we will continue to see changes taking place to the traditional transaction model in terms of the consumer's ability to access information prior to establishing a relationship with an agent. However, I feel it is essential for Agents and Brokers to understand that in order to best serve Customers and Clients, is that good Agents need good Brokers and good Brokers need good Agents. This will require that we keep up with emerging technologies, real estate legislation, and other trends that affect the level of service we give to the agents, which will, in turn, affect the level of service they give to their customers and clients.Question: Where do you see First Weber Group Realtors in the next several years?Expansion and growth! Being owned now by Berkshire Hathaway has created many strong partnerships with both local and National companies. We will continue to brand the First Weber Group name across Wisconsin.","first_name":"Roger Rushman (JC Mgr)\n","middle_name":"","last_name":"","website":"","email":"rrushman@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/148317ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["(414) 333-5313"],"office_phone_numbers":["262 646-6800"],"social":{},"country":"United States"}

I take your real estate expectations seriously and respect every transaction as if it were my own - I understand its not just a house, it's your home!I was introduced to the real estate industry shortly after college and became hooked.

I became a licensed WI Real Estate agent in 1995 and a WI licensed Broker in 2011.To get away, my family enjoys our Wisconsin travels. We make excursions to the Chain O Lakes area in the summer, and skiing in the Upper Peninsula in the winter. On the home front, it is not unusual for us to be in the midst of a remodeling project and we enjoy brainstorming for new design ideas. When relaxing I relish my time for reading and share my love of reading as a Schools of Hope literacy volunteer for local elementary students (and look forward to volunteering again post CoVid).

Graduate: UWMadison CLIENT TESTIMONIALS: \"Our realtor, Kate Grace, knocked the sale of our house out of the park! Her keen eye, sensibility, cleanliness, and friendly professionalism made getting our home ready to be listed straightforward. Kate instructed us what we needed to do to get the house ready, and shortly there after we were ready. Kates extensive realty experience and intelligent comps helped us to land on a realistic number that we would list the house for. Typically, one would think that January in Wisconsin is not a great time to list a house. Kate listed our home around 2PM and we received numerous requests for showing by 10PM. The following morning, we had an offer for over $10,000 of our asking price! Kate did not stop there. Kate helped us navigate the buyers inspections, appraisal and some subsequent minor issues with our house that were easily resolved. When I was going to use a contractor that wanted $1600 to fix something, she put us in touch with a reliable and well-known contractor that charged us $450. Thank you for all your help! \" Ryan H. - Madison, WI We recently sold our house and Kate Grace was our realtor. We had a great experience with Kate. She is so knowledgeable in her field. Kate also has many resources to tap into to help with staging and contractors. Kate also put us at ease when it came to any bumps in the road. I will definitely recommend her to anyone who asks. Thank you Kate for getting us multiple showings and an offer over asking price!Respectfully, Dena H. (Dena and Ryan, Sellers, Madison, WI)\"Kate helped us immensely every step of the way from shopping for homes till we signed for our new home at the title company. She was able to coach us on expectations along the way which helped reduce our stress level. She responded immediately with all concerns and questions. She was a great council. We could not have done without her help. Thanks, Kate for finding our new home!\" Pamela and Greg T. - Sun Prairie, WI (Buyers)\"We turned to Kate a second time when deciding to make a change. She was great with listening to what we wanted and helping us to find our new home. We highly recommend her for her professionalism, ease to work with, and her willingness to help at any time. She was knowledgeable of the inventory and was quick to respond to our needs. Hoping this is our forever home, but if we need services again, we wouldn't hesitate to contact Kate.\" Paul and Kris M. - Windsor, WI (Buyers and Sellers)\"Kate has been my Realtor for my entire home buying and selling life. We have worked together on 4 homes over the last 20 years. I would never think of using anyone else, and I have recommended her to many friends and family members over the years. You simply cannot find anyone who does a better job or will work harder than Kate does. Our current house wasn't even on the market when Kate showed it to us. Don't hesitate for a second to contact Kate, whatever your Real Estate needs may be now and in the future.\"Todd E.  Sun Prairie, WI (Buyer and Seller) \"Kate Grace of the Cottage Grove Rd office was our buyer's agent and I am delighted to say that her expertise made our home buying experience a complete success! We were relocating from out of state and I had a specific set of criteria for the house I wanted to buy--type of house, price, neighborhood, time- frame of closing. I made a trip to Madison to view some homes with Kate but returned home without an accepted purchase offer. I was so impressed with Kate that I knew I wanted to continue to work with her. Despite low inventory, Kate found the perfect house for us a month later! Kate toured the house with 3 of my local relatives, took videos and photos, and after some conferring, we placed an offer that was accepted! Thank goodness for Kate's use of modern technology....electronic signature capability for documents, facilitating inspection from afar, frequent emails....our long-distance purchase was stress-free! When we finally saw the house before closing, it was exactly as expected and we are so pleased to be the new owners! Kate was such a blessing to us and I highly recommend her, especially if you are relocating into the competitive Madison housing market!\" Karen and David T. - Madison, WI (Buyers) After 28 years of home ownership, I was ready for less work. Kates professional expertise in preparing my home for sale, resulted in it selling in less than a week. Kate found an ideal place (condo) and worked for me to make sure I got it. I was thrilled with her professional yet personal service. Details and deadlines, Kate didnt miss a thing.Peg B.  Madison, WI (Buyer and Seller) \"As first time home buyers, we were pretty nervous about buying a home. Kate Grace made sure we were comfortable with the process and found us the perfect home that fit everything on our checklist! We had a pretty tricky set of requirements in mind for our home, especially for our area. Kate wasn't pushy and didn't try to show us a home that wasn't right for our needs. I recommend Kate to all my friends and anybody who is looking for a realtor! Thanks, Kate!\"Jake W. and Sara W.  DeForest, WI (Buyers) The sale of our home was the most significant financial transaction we have made to date. We certainly did not take the selection of a Real Estate Partner lightly and having Kate Grace on our side throughout the journey was the most critical component to the successful close of your sale. Were my wife and I to re-enter the market to purchase another property, we would not hesitate to enlist Kate again. As clients that relied greatly on her expertise throughout our sale, we are proud and honored to give her our highest recommendation.Jason M.

I came from a big family and we dressed up for church and any family get together that wasn't a picnic. We took family vacations to visit relatives who were spread out across the US and saw some great national treasures along the way. My dream when I was little was to be a housewife. Not kidding. I love taking care of a home: the cooking, the cleaning, the inside, the outside...all of it! It gives me great pride!Fast forward to coming of age in the '80s when women were being told we could have it all, but at the heart of it, I was always feeling like \"home\" was where I belonged. Somehow \"having it all\" excluded my love affair with 'home.'A college degree and a few jobs later, I landed in Southwest Wisconsin where I raised my family in a charming town that is the county seat, home to Lands' End, Walnut Hollow, QLF, Upland Hills Hospital and a great school system. Know what else is great about my (new) hometown, Dodgeville: Pride, Passion & Community Spirit! As I've navigated through my 24+ years of real estate, I've learned that my good friend, Dorothy, from The Wizard of Oz was right: \"There's no place like home.\" I love the people, the varied communities and counties, and the traditions. I do my research and learn as much as I can about a property before I list it. When we're viewing properties together, I'm listening and taking in your feedback so I can learn what you like and don't like, and to find out what questions you might have. I'm big on disclosure, wanting to educate you along the way.I've spent most of my real estate career with First Weber and I stay here because First Weber is a cutting-edge leader in real estate, and I'm proud to be a part of that energy and mindset.Are you thinking of listing? I'VE GOT THE STRATEGIES! I can coach you on how to sell in a low-inventory market, how to stage and why it's critical to set yourself up for greatness when the showings start. I know how to manage that \"but I don't have a place to move to\" conundrum and I know how to conduct showings to keep you safe during the Pandemic. I'll be sure that there's plenty of documentation available, when necessary, for potential buyers - whether they are 1 mile or 1,000 miles away from you. Let's chat about my marketing strategy and what it entails!Are you in the market to buy property? I know where to find answers to almost any question you might have. What is not available with a listing I can often uncover for you. In this market you may encounter wells and septic systems or maybe zoning will be important to you. It's important to me that you have what's important to you to proceed, and as your Buyer Agent, I'll coach you smoothly through the process, giving you options, advice & opinions along the way.Whether you're buying or selling.......I'm skilled in a variety of transactions: single family, new construction, condos, rural property, farms, land & commercial. When I don't know an answer, I find someone who does! I love this industry and have served many capacities and roles in local Realtor organizations. I've received awards for production and service to my industry and my company. I've recruited agents, managed agents, and trained them. Community is important to me, too, and I am a huge fan of local businesses and entrepreneurs.What's Next?If the Pandemic has taught me one thing, it's underscored the importance of Family, Home & Community, not to mention my belief that non-profits are an important ingredient in the future of small town success. This is where I choose to focus my time: My Family - and Yours; My Home - and Yours; My Community - and Yours. Simply put, 'We Survive Together.'Staying Safe During the PandemicI offer in-person and virtual showings using different platforms (steady cell connection required). While some things have changed about how we show homes during this time, one thing hasn't changed: Buyers still want to buy, and Sellers still want to sell.","first_name":"Nancy","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Smith","website":"https://NancySmith.firstweber.com","email":"smithnk@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/6987ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":[],"office_phone_numbers":["(608) 935-9776"],"social":{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/NancyKSmithRealEstate","twitter_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancysmith/","other_urls":["https://www.instagram.com/smithnkay/"]},"country":"United States"}

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm with people interested in working with me as a Seller's Agent or a Buyer's Agent. I have been a licensed real estate Broker since 1987. In addition, I've gone on to earn CRS, GRI, and ASP certifications. My strengths are my knowledge of the Jefferson & Dane County areas, as well as my reputation for providing honest and professional service.... hopefully with a little dash of humor! My goal is to receive the highest marks from my clients/customers. Without their approval, I have fallen short on my promise of professional service. A happy customer is the best advertising I could hope for. Meet Melanie BeckerBorn and raised in Fort Atkinson, I absolutely love everything that Jefferson County has to offer and I know the area well. This knowledge allows me to assist my clients in locating and selecting properties that meet their specific wants and needs. As a local business owner, I'm also an active member of the Fort Atkinson Area Chamber of Commerce and have served as the Retail Chairperson and sat on the Board of Directors. My care for this community runs deep and I enjoy showing people why they should make it their home too. Meet Ben BeckerMy main goal as a real estate agent is to build trusting relationships with my clients. I strive for an easy and smooth process when helping people buy or list a house. Buying and selling a house is a major decision in people's lives, and I would love to help make this process enjoyable and memorable. Living in the Jefferson County area my whole life, I have knowledge of the surrounding areas and knowledge of the local landscapes. I attended Jefferson High School and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. In my free time, I can be found outside any chance I get. I enjoy being a sportsman around the county, riding my bicycle, and hiking the local trails.

I came to Madison to take a UW professorship and only later turned to my other love, real estate. Each has its own rewards and, for me, they've been great choices because they are both ways in which to work with people. Over the years, the city has changed -- and much for the better. Among those changes have been the evolution of State Street, the farmers' market, the Overture Center for the Arts, the revitalization of many older neighborhoods, burgeoning bike paths, and the development of condominium projects throughout the metropolitan area.

I was born in Wakefield, Mi and grew up here in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I am married, Bonnie, and have 2 grown children and 4 grand children. I currently live on Lake Gogebic, a +13,000 acre fresh water lake in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I have been in the Lake Gogebic area hunting and fishing here since 1962. I know this area well. I am a Northern Michigan University (NMU) graduate-1974. I majored in Business Administration/Accounting and Finance. I owned and operated The Chalet Party and Convenience Store, Inc in Wakefield for +24 years, had a 31 year career with the USPS and worked for the USPS in Wakefield, Bessemer, Ironwood, Marenisco in Michigan and also in Crivitz, Wi. While attending college I worked part time at Indianhead Mtn. Ski Corp and Connors Forest Industries in Wakefield, Mi..

With my growing up on the western end of the U P, living, working and investing in this area, I have seen many real estate market swings.

While living full time on Lake Gogebic my wife and I leased and operated a resort, Whitetail Lodging, am currently property managing 6 short term rental properties- casadalago.com and have enjoyed the good life on this lake while being a land owner in the Upper Peninsula. You may ask \"Why real estate\" for me later in life. Why not do something you are very knowledgeable and familiar with. I really enjoy the people whom I have met and hope to meet, helping them make reasonable decisions on investing their time and resources with their local real estate needs. My First Weber employment gives me the opportunity and leads me back to my roots of helping and servicing people interesting in coming to our area, as I have done most of my life.

Our family vacationed up here all our lives and I must confess it doesn't take long to lose your heart to this area given the beauty of it's land and the people. I have recently acquired my Michigan Broker License and taken on the responsibility of Associate Broker in our Bessemer Office. I am relatively new, (8 years experience) to the real estate business with a true thirst for connecting people to their perfect destination so they may be as fortunate as I to enjoy what this area has to offer. Growing up here has been one adventure to say the least. From a city girl to bird hunting, deer hunting, bear hunting, hiking, snowshoeing, fishing, camping, kayaking; I soon learned what a great life exists up here. I live on the far western end of the Upper Pennisula which is very near the Wisconsin border and for that reason I felt it relevant to acquire a license in both Michigan and Wisconsin. I am excited about this new venture and love working with people as I have done so all my life. My family built and ran the Root Cellar resort and restaurant on Lake Gogebic for 29 years. It was in that experience that I became interested in real estate as I watched customers come and stay, fall in love with the Northwoods and eventually get their very own slice of God's country! My wish is to be able to assist in making those dreams come true and sincerely look forward to meeting with you and taking that journey whether buying or selling a property.

Testimonials:My husband and I purchased our first home with Kathy. While the process of finding a home can be overwhelming, Kathy's knowledge of a home's structure and function allowed us to ensure we knew exactly what we were getting. When a project that we negotiated to have done was not done to her standards, she made the calls to ensure that it was done properly before closing. We have been extremely happy with our purchase and would gladly utilize Kathy again. We have recently referred two other couples to her who have successfully purchased homes as well. J and T of WaukeshaI have worked with Kathy on several occasions over the last eight years. She is always quick to respond to questions or tasks and does so extremely professionally and articulately. I trust her completely and would happily recommend her to anyone who is considering buying or selling their home. She has a genuine interest in the success of her clients in their real estate endeavors. TS of SussexKathy helped us both sell our old home and subsequently purchase our current home. She guided us every step along the way offering her expertise and experience to smooth out any rough bumps. When we had a question about the process, Kathy was readily available to either give us direct answers or find someone who could help. She was with us every step of the way. In fact, she made herself available to us even after we had completed our move by offering us her \"concierge\" services, which gave us access to contractors and other vendors to help us get settled in. D and C in BrookfieldKathy is a very responsive person & intense realtor with tremendous initiative. Our house was for sale by owner over a year with very little interest by potential buyers. Needless to say it was not sold. We contacted Kathy through First Weber, conferred with her about what we would like to get price wise. She had many suggestions about what we could do to make our house more attractive and salable. We followed her advise and within 60 days our house was sold. During the sale of the house, Kathy had many potential buyers looking at it, and in fact the house could have been sold 3 weeks prior to the actual sale as we had two families negotiating with Kathy for our house. The family that bought our house ended paying us more than $2,000 from the original offer. Kathy is a very resilient realtor, one that followed through on our concerns & thoughts. She was very cooperative and her personality is a delight. We're pretty sure our house selling days are over but if we ever change our minds, we would track her down, she left that big of an impression on us. B and J, OconomowocKathy helped us sell our condo and find our new home. She was very knowledgeable and helpful on both the buying and selling ends of the process. We couldn't have asked for more. She seemed to know all the answers, and if she didn't, she made sure to find them right away. We've recommended her to our friends and will continue to do so. If we ever sell again, she'll be the one that we call.

I take those extra steps to develop lasting relationships where clients become friends. My goal is to be available for any of your questions or concerns, and to work with your best interests in mind - ALWAYS.Prior to becoming a full-time Realtor, I worked in corporate communications, and also as a television reporter/meteorologist. I've moved several times, know it's stressful, and will work hard to make it smooth transaction for you. With my communications and marketing background, I'm able to easily explain the process, and walk you through every step.For home sellers, I will identify what you need to do to get your home ready for sale - for top dollar. My marketing skills will help highlight your home, so more serious buyers will see it. For buyers, I'm familiar with the area and neighborhoods. I'm patient, give my honest input, and will be there throughout the entire process.If you are interested in buying or selling, please give me a call at (414) 861-0387. I look forward to working with you. TestimonialsLyra has been an exceptional support and guide throughout my journey searching for and purchasing my home! I truly cannot say enough about her as a person and as a professional. (In fact, I cannot say enough about Lyra and her partner and husband, Steve, who both helped me throughout the process! They are outstanding!) I met Lyra (and Steve) by chance as I started my home search online, selecting her from among other agents listed to schedule a tour of a home that was for sale by another real estate company - and I am grateful that chance helped us meet! From the start, Lyra has been amazingly patient, kind, and understanding of my many questions. I never felt pressured at all through the process. Lyra and Steve both stressed from the beginning that the home search was a marathon not a sprint, and that they would do all they could to help me find just the right home. Lyra was supportive and often protective, truly taking the time to get to know me and understand the type of house and community I hoped to find. I truly appreciate their integrity, honesty, and guidance. And while I plan to be in my new home for a long, long while, I would without hesitation strongly recommend her to any of my friends or family who are looking to purchase or sell a home in the future. They will be in excellent hands!\" - Beth, MilwaukeeWe highly recommend this team, whether you are buying or selling. They are professional, knowledgeable, and very patient. Unfortunately we were \"thrown a curve\" during the home selling process by another agent, and our team was able to walk us through the process of dealing with this situation. Happily everything turned out OK, exactly as they projected. It is very unique to have both the male/female perspective when dealing with a home sale and with Lyra and Steve you get both.....with a great sense of humor thrown in! Neil & Susy, OconomowocLyra was so great to work with. I feel very lucky to have been able to buy my first home with her help and will definitely contact her with any future real estate endeavors. Can not say enough good things about her. She genuinely cares about your experience and about finding the style of home that you are looking for. I wish I came across more people who really cared about doing their job well the way she does.  Chelsea, MilwaukeeLyra was wonderful to work with. She made the process of selling my home easy and reduced my worries by answering all my questions respectfully and promptly. I truly enjoyed working with her.  - Janeen, Elkhorn Lyra was absolutely wonderful to work with. She walked us through every step ... even long distance. Best real estate experience ever.

In fact, her summer job as a receptionist at a Southfield, Michigan real estate office was such a good fit that she continued it right through her college years. The work suited Amy's friendly personality and introduced her to the many complexities of the real estate world.After graduating from Michigan State University, Amy parlayed her people skills into a career in broadcast advertising sales and sales management. That offered her new opportunities to build her negotiation and customer-service skills. But her early love of real estate continued to pull at Amy's thoughts and she finally decided to make it official. She became a licensed, full-time Realtor, an Accredited Buyers Representative (ABR), and a Relocation Specialist.A Wisconsin Resident since 1994, Amy has worked with clients throughout the Greater Milwaukee area. Her husband Rob joined the practice a few years ago. They currently reside in Pewaukee with their three children, their cat Tico and a mini-golden doodle named Maizie. Amy's patience, attention to detail, and deep regional knowledge helps her connect with all types of clients and properties - from first time home buyers to empty nesters, from modest condos to upscale estates. \"I love my job!\" Amy says. \"I get to help people fulfill their real estate dreams and I love every part of the process, from meeting new clients and getting to know them as I'm showing them properties or listing their home, to negotiating the deal, and finally sitting down together at the closing table.\" Amy's brand of personal service is why buyers and sellers choose her over other agents.Clients consistently comment on her straight-shooting honesty, negotiating skills, and ability to eliminate obstacles. \"The client is always first,\" Amy says. \"I want every client to feel like they're my only client. When a client is caught up in a sale or purchase, that's the only thing that matters; they don't want to wait around wondering. I'm a total stickler for communication, keeping my clients informed and returning calls and emails right away. I treat others as I like to be treated - with care and respect.\"That formula has earned Amy Krieghoff the admiration of clients and colleagues alike.

She was very helpful in keeping me calm when the buyer changed dates. She was great in reassuring me that everything would work out...and it did. She was very patient with me while asking many questions.\" Lauren Burback__________________________________________________________________________________\"Cricket was great she was always there to talk when I had a question or concern. My house sold very quickly after being listed with another agent for a much longer period. \" K Wilkes__________________________________________________________________________________ \"Margaret was extremely helpful from day one. Her knowledge of the real estate world is top notch and she isn't afraid to give her opinion, which was great to have as a first time home buyer.

Mary Jane whose shoes are pretty hard to fill; that is to say we loved Mary Jane almost as much as her grandkids do; deservingly retired from real estate. Well needless to say 10 year later basicly feeling a bit lost without Mary Jane, I found myself paging through the long list of real estate agents. One morning I stopped upon Margaret Harris's contact on firstweber.com. My wife and I on some random trade wind both wondered what combination of experience and spiritual professionalism it would take to sell our home fast! One week later we knew we had made the right choice with an accepted offer and more importantly with Margaret Harris. Her postive energy is brought to each closing. My families experience however random... I know she will experience a long and successful career. The key factor for us as family with two young boys was that the sale of our home was so fluid and with easy it barely seemed noteable. Thanks Margaret =)\" -The Fleury Family___________________________________________________________________________________\"Margaret came to our first listing appointment well prepared with everything we needed to make an informed decision on listing our home. We followed her recommendations on when to list and the pricing plan. The day our home was active on MLS their were many showing appointments being scheduled.

As first time home buyers we had lots of questions and concerns. She addressed each with patience, and took great care to provide us with a clear understanding of the process from beginning to end. Margaret identified several fantastic options within our budget, and we would not be in the house we?re in today without her help and skillful negotiation. I would (and will!) wholeheartedly recommend Margaret to anyone who needs a trusted partner in real estate. Thank you Margaret!!\" John & Holly___________________________________________________________________________________\"Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to making house hunting fun and to your knowledge of REO.

Everything my relative had to say about Margaret was accurate. Margaret puts forth a lot of effort to meet the needs of her clients, and it is clear that her clients' needs are her top priority. She was knowledgeable, honest, and genuine throughout the entire search and final closing on my purchase. At no point during the time I worked with Margaret did she ever seem like she was really trying to sell me a certain property just to make a sale, which I greatly appreciated because there were some periods of time during my search where I had to re-evaluate my priorities. Margaret always asked me what I liked and didn't like about each property we visited, which made me believe that she truly cared about what I needed/wanted and didn't need/want in a home. Her approach ultimately made me feel much more comfortable and confident in the decision I made. I highly recommend contacting Margaret Harris with the First Weber Group of Brookfield to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.\" -John Briggs ___________________________________________________________________________________ \"Margaret made this the best ever purchase of real estate. She was helpful answering all of my questions and a good listener. She let me explain my concerns and goals. I felt she gave me 100% always promptly answering my questions by phone or e-mail and accommodating my schedule. Her attention to detail made the entire process go smoothly without any problems. She coordinated the financing, building inspection, and resolution of radon and plumbing issues and saved me a lot of time and trouble. Throughout the sale she was very professional and efficient. I will definitely contact her on future real estate transactions. I can rely on her knowledge and expertise. The welcome package she gave us topped off a wonderful experience. I would not hesitate to recommend her to friends and colleagues.\" Sincerely, Robert G. Saur D.D.S.___________________________________________________________________________________ \"Choosing Margaret Harris as our realtor to help us buy our first home was one of the first and best decisions my wife and I made together. Margaret is very professional, easy, and fun to work with and she really understands the market, especially in the greater Milwaukee area. One of my favorite things about working with Margaret is that she made buying a house a learning experience. She took the time to explain everything to us. When we made our first offer on a house, she sat down with us and explained every single document we signed so it was clear to us what we were signing. She is very thorough, we never felt rushed and she made sure ALL our questions were answered. We never felt pressured into buying a home which is something I half expected a realtor to do. In fact, she advised us to go with our gut when buying a house, which we did and now we are in our new home and couldn't be happier! I always felt like she gave us honest advice and that we could trust her. She is someone who I would definitely use again, when the time comes.

It is a passion of mine to work with architecture and design. I have always had a love of buildings whether old or new, and cherish the fact that God gave me a gift of seeing potential in things that others have trouble seeing. I now find that I love the people I am meeting along the way and find my past skills extremely handy in helping buyers and sellers see and reach their dream of buying or selling a home. I love to walk through properties with people wanting to purchase property and see their reactions. I wait to see if they find the part of the home they know makes it the one they want. I also love working with sellers who have the dream of moving on in their lives. It is usually a very exciting time for them, and I want to see them get on their way as soon as possible. I love watching ideas and dreams grow and reach fruition.I am also married and the mother of six children, ages 19-34. I consider this the most wonderful of any full time jobs. My eldest daughter lives in Miami and is a Yacht Broker and Marketing Director for Barclay Tuck Yachts. My second oldest is in Michigan. She has her master's degree in Special Education; her husband is in residency for Orthopedic Surgery. She stays at home with my very special granddaughters, Juliet, Adeline and Thea. My third child just graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison. He is studying for the MCAT and hopes to enter medical school next year. My fourth child is twenty seven and lives at home. She has special needs and is a joy in my life. Then, there are the final two, the older is 22 and works full time at Walgreens; the younger at 19 is off to college.

In 1999 I became a REALTOR in the exciting field of residential real estate. Helping people through the process of Buying and Selling a home is engaging. The process can be stressful and very rewarding. It is my position to have the process be as stress free for the Buyer and Seller as possible. To do this I listen to what is being shared. Learning the wants and desires that the Buyers are looking for in their home. For the Seller, I listen to learn the motivation for the sale of the home. The use of electronics is important to stay in contact with what is happening in the market; reaching out to Buyers and Sellers with updates and so much more. However, it is the human side that is most important; and that is what I maintain when I work with Buyers and Sellers in Helping To Make The Right Move in their real estate decisions. My home base is Appleton. I serve the Fox Cities, Shawano and Waupaca areas. I look forward to serving you.","first_name":"Lori","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Bishop","website":"https://loribishop.firstweber.com","email":"bishopl@firstweber.com","image_url":"https://www.redata.com/100001/firstweber/agents/89726ax.jpg","agent_phone_numbers":["(920) 419-0235"],"office_phone_numbers":["(920) 750-6880"],"social":{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/LoriBishopRealtorWI","twitter_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loribishoprealtor/","other_urls":[]},"country":"United States"}

I am passionate about the Real Estate business, because it is so rewarding to see Buyers and Sellers obtain their objective, and know that I played an intricate part of that. I am a born & raised Baraboo resident, so I have great knowledge of our community & our market. I am a firm believer in being 100% honest and up front with both Buyers and Sellers, and telling them what they NEED to hear, even when it is not what they WANT to hear After-all, that is what they hire me to do! I have sold properties as low as $10,000 and Commercial properties as high as $4,000,000+, and I appreciate and take pride in each and every transaction that I am involved in. It takes the small ones to get the big ones, and neither is more important than the other. I am proud to say that I have worked with First Weber Realty since 2003, and don't see myself anywhere else. First Weber provides us agents with all of the best & cutting edge tools to effectively market & Sell properties. When other companies were just \"holding tight, and trying to survive\" thru the market downturn in approx. 2008, First Weber was one of the only companies that continued to invest in their brand and the tools that they could offer us agents, and they continue to do that today! I believe that no company can offer the tools and Marketing that First Weber has available to us, and that is why I am proud to work here - Wisconsin's largest and most productive Real Estate firm!
