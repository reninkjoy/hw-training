Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 

Class   
	A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from 
	which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes 
	and methods. 
	example
		class ClassName:
		   # Statement-1
		   .
		   .
		   .
		   # Statement-N
Objects
	The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any 
	real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, 
	floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. 
	example
	obj = Dog()

Methods
	Methods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about 	an object, or update an object’s data. The method’s code is defined in the class definition.	
	
The __init__ method 	constructors
	The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. 
	example
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		
Destructor
	def __del__(self):	
		
Polymorphism
	Polymorphism simply means having many forms
	1. Method Overriding
		Runtime polymorphism uses method overriding. In method overriding, a child class can 		provide a different implementation than its parent class.
	2. Method Overloading
		Methods or functions may have the same name, but a different number of parameters 			passed into the method call. Different results may occur depending on the number of 		parameters passed in.
		
Encapsulation
	we have created the variable as the private attribute. We cannot even access this attribute
	directly and can’t even change its value.
	 
Abstraction
	Abstraction means that the user interacts with only selected attributes and methods of an 		object. Abstraction uses simplified, high level tools, to access a complex object.
	
Inheritance
	Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another 
	class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the 		class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. 
	Hierarchical Inheritance:
	Multilevel Inheritance 
	Multiple Inheritance:
	Single Inheritance:
	
Python Function

*args 
	The special syntax *args in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number 
	of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-key worded, variable-length argument
	list.

**kwargs
	The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, 
	variable-length argument list. We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is 
	because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).
	
yield
	The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but 
	retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the 
	function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. 

lambda
	lambda arguments : expression 
	g = lambda x: x*x*x
	print(g(7)) output is 7 cube
	
Immutability
	Immutability is a functional programming paradigm can be used for debugging as it will throw 
	an error where the variable is being changed not where the value is changed. Python too 
	supports some immutable data types like string, tuple, numeric, etc.
